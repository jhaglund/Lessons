git commands:

git init (create a repo, you only do this once)
git status (see what's going on with the repository)
git add (add a file to a commit -- this doesn't commit it tho)
git commit (commits the files that have been added)
git diff (see what's different between two versions
	git diff -- see what's changed and not yet committed
	git diff HEAD^ -- diff the current HEAD with one version back
	git diff HEAD^^ -- same, but two versions back
